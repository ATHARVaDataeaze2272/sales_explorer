## Content, messaging and marketing material

## Content / Key messages

Q3.0

The purpose here is to get an understanding of the core value proposition &amp; unique selling points that will be utilized by the audience acquisition team in their outreach activities when communicating with prospects for the meeting scheduling. In a paragraph or two ( 300- 500 words ), please outline:

- What the core value proposition is and what the USPs are?
- Why should the target prospect be interested? How are we helping them?
- What challenges do we solve/address?

LotusFlare Digital Network Operator® (DNO™) Cloud is a cloud commerce and monetization platform that serves as a digital business support system (BSS) for communications and media services providers that is focused on helping enterprises achieve valuable business outcomes. Unlike most BSS platforms, DNO Cloud was developed from 'Experience Down' to allow greater innovation agility, better customer engagement across all digital channels, improved customer acquisition, and increased retention and monetization of network assets while reducing operational costs.

CSPs look to LotusFlare to be their 'innovation engine'. The outcomes that it drives for its customers include launching digital fiber businesses, developing API marketplaces / NaaS, MVNO enablement (also known as Wireless as a Service (WaaS)), launching digital flanker brands, replatforming legacy BSS and eSIM orchestration and enablement.

Currently, LotusFlare is working on outcomes in the B2B2X and B2C spaces, which our leaders are happy to present during MWC 2025.

- The B2B outcomes are in three specific areas: first, digital API marketplaces, a very hot topic with EMEA CSPs and where LotusFlare supports the T-Mobile DevEdge API marketplace using LotusFlare DNO Cloud and Camara API standards; second, MVNO enablement supporting the wholesale divisions of MNOs offering virtual networks services to brands based on an all-digital BSS that flexibly adapts (including white-label mobile app and website) to the needs of the brand; and third, the creation of enabling solutions specifically for providers of ICT services based on TMForum APIs.
- The B2C outcomes are targeted in 2 areas: first, business agility with accelerated launch of flanker brands to enable CSP to capture very targeted market segments with digital multi-service propositions, and second, increased ROI through accelerated re-platforming of monolithic legacy BSS platforms
