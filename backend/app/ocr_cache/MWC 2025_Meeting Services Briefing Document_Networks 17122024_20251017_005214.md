Content, messaging and marketing material

Q2.0

The purpose here is to get an understanding of the core **value proposition** &amp; **unique selling points** that will be utilized by the audience acquisition team in their outreach activities when communicating with prospects for the meeting scheduling. In **a paragraph or two** ( **300- 500 words** ), please outline:

- What the core value proposition is and what the USPs are?
- Why should the target prospect be interested? How are we helping them?
- What challenges do we solve/address?

For this event, we want to focus specifically on the **enterprise and MNOs verticals** .

Delivering connectivity services solely through terrestrial network infrastructure can come with economic, feasibility, and reliability challenges, especially when connecting in remote areas, developing regions, or where immediate establishment of services is crucial.

Carriers, MNOs, and other telecommunications providers have turned to Intelsat for solutions to expand networks and bring predictable service to more users.

MNOs:

Managed Cellular Backhaul

Intelsat [CellBackhaul](https:/www.intelsat.com/isps-mnos-telcos/solutions/managed-cellular-backhaul) is a fully managed cellular backhaul service where Intelsat manages all the satellite components connecting towers to the MNOs’ core. With quick deployment time and economical delivery of connectivity enabling reliable 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, and IoT, MNOs can keep their business growing and their customers happy.

*Example/use case* *: an MNO leveraging Intelsat CellBackhaul as they are looking at expanding their 4G coverage to more subscribers in remote or rural areas where fiber and microwave technologies are hard or impossible to deploy. The expansion of their mobile coverage with the deployment of the CellBackhaul solution also enabled the MNO to comply with the country regulations and meet the associated coverage targets.*

**Enterprise:** Making enterprise-grade networking more widely accessible than ever, Intelsat Enterprise Networking services provide the critical lifeline needed to fuel innovation and digital transformation strategies through secure, reliable private networking, SD-WAN and cloud connectivity, and internet access for proven dependability, vast reach, and fast deployment.

**IoT**

Industrial IoT has moved beyond supporting a trickle of data from a few remote sensors. Now expectations include supporting real-time, always-on connectivity for both monitoring and control.

Using Intelsat [FlexEnterprise for IoT backhaul](https:/www.intelsat.com/isps-mnos-telcos/products/flexenterprise-iot) to complement cellular and terrestrial connectivity can extend the reach and effectiveness of your IoT deployments and drive better results for you and your customers.

With an end-to-end satellite backhaul solution ready to plug into your existing network, FlexEnterprise IoT opens new use cases for your organization. By extending IoT connectivity globally – regardless of local cellular and fiber availability – you’ll incorporate devices and infrastructure from every enterprise location to drive forward your organization’s digital initiatives.

From low-data-rate SCADA to richer IP-based connectivity incorporating video and high-throughput data streams, FlexEnterprise IoT helps you address requirements for every site, device, and sensor.

*Example/use case* *:  a company leveraging Intelsat FlexEnterprise solution as they are expanding their presence in new geographical areas with limited or unexistant fiber connectivity, or when connectivity backup is needed.*

*At MWC 2023, Intelsat announced that Deutsche Telekom IoT (DT IoT) intended to integrate Intelsat FlexEnterprise into its cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) offering to extend powerful, easy-to-use IoT solutions to locations regardless of the availability of fiber or cellular connectivity options. By using FlexEnterprise to complement cellular connectivity, DT can extend the reach and effectiveness of its solution and drive better results for its customers.* [Read more.](https:/www.intelsat.com/newsroom/intelsat-expands-global-reach-for-deutsche-telekom-iot)
