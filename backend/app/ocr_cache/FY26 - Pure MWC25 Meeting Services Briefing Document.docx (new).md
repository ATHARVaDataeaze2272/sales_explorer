## Power and Space Reduction

consumption by 85% or more compared to other all-flash storage, and even more when used to replace disk. Pure manufactures their full flash hardware (DFM's) whicgh are NOT based on dish or SSD. We also have our own unique software.

## Challenges Pure Solves

* Lack of reliability in CEPH deployments

By replacing node-based CEPH storage with Pure FlashArray, telcos achieve much exceptional power and space savings.

* Challenges with OpenStack data storage

Data storage can be a complex part of OpenStack deployments. Pure Storage

* Moving Al from test to production

As telcos turn increasingly to Al projects, data storage can be a limiting factor. Pure offers storage that scales easily as projects grow, as well as purchasing options that eliminate the risk of over- or under-buying.

* Transition to Cloud-native services

Moving from a device-centric or virtualized environment to containers can be challenging. Pure has storage and software solutions that greatly simplify the transition and can speed your transformation.
